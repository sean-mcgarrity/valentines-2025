## Be My Valentine

This was a quick side project I did to ask someone out in a totally normal and not exceedingly nerdy way. She said yes. 

It's built using Svelte and Tailwind, a small table on a Supabase Postgres DB, and is hosted on vercel. It was a fun excuse to play around with the [neobrutalism](https://dribbble.com/shots/20764973-Neobrutalism-UI-How-to) style of web design that is all the rage. 

The first page counted down to Valentine's 2025, but now it just says "0" because we're past the date.
